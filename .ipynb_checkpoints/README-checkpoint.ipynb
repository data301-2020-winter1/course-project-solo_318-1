    "The Data set I have chosen contains detailed records of Airbnb properties /apartments. It has records of the date certain properties are available. It has records of the maximum and minimum nights that the property is available for. It also has extensive data about reviews left on the property by tenants who have just stayed there. The data about reviews also states the last time that a review was left on a property and the frequency of reviews left on properties.\n",
    "My interest in this topic is because Iâ€™ve always been curious about the factors that cause price fluctuations in Airbnb properties. Another reason of interest is the fact that I am fascinated by the city of Toronto and would like to know what kind of accommodation I should expect when trying to visit.\n",
    "With all of these statistics I hope to:\n",
    "1.\tFind the most prominent room type available on Airbnb Toronto. Find the order of prominence of the room types as a whole.\n",
    "2.\tDetermine the relationship of the price of room types and the minimum nights spent in those room types.\n",
